# The site reads its databases from `releases/latest/download/`, which does not
# fall back to an older release: a release published without them breaks the
# next render. This script exists so that cannot happen by accident.
#
# `source_root` defaults to the pipeline output tree next door. Every name in
# _scripts/release-assets.txt is located by name underneath it, and nothing is
# created until all of them are found.
#
# Run it BEFORE pushing main, so the assets are in place when CI renders.
